<div><h3>Problem Statement:</h3></div>
<h4>Companies:</h4>During online interviews, hiring managers might request candidates to write code via screensharing. Its not possible to observe if code passes all testcases and if the logic is correct. Also there's no tool to generate a detailed skills report  of student on the interview session
<h4>Students:</h4>Students often struggle to choose the right learning paths and lack the preparation and domain knowledge that companies seek. This leads to nervousness and poor interview performance.
